# factory_graph_theory (v0.0.0-alpha)
=========
This Node.js library provides a number of classes that facilitate exploring your data as a graph.

## Installation

  npm install git://github.com/tfpractice/factory_graph_theory.git --save

## Usage
The three primary classes in the library are Node, Graph, and Edge, which can provide useful functionlaity when determining relationships between a multifaceted set of related objects.


### Nodes
Nodes are instantiated with a label attribute (for identification) and a data attribute (for extensibility with your own classes).
For Example, consider tracking a dataset containing related city objects each with a population attribute. These could be modeled like so:

~~~~javascript
var GT = require('factory_graph_theory'),
mwk = new GT.node("milwaukee",{population:3.3}),
phil = new GT.Node("philadelphia",{population:2.7}),
nyc = new GT.Node("new york city",{population:8});
~~~~

These three nodes now exist independent of each other until brought together by edges.

### Edges
Edges provide a relation between two nodes, and can be given a certain "weight". In this example, the weight could act as a distance between them.
    
~~~~javascript
var mw_p = new GT.Edge(mwk, phil, 400),
p_nyc = new GT.Edge(phil, nyc, 200),
nyc_mwk = new GT.Edge(nyc, mwk, 500);
~~~~

These entities are also separate, and can be brought together using the Graph Class. Allowing multiple Graphs to be formed from the same set of noes from different prespectives.

### Graph
The Graph class is basically a connection of Nodes and Edges with methods that allow traversal in a certain order/fashion. Graphs are initialized with NodeArray and EdgeArray attributes to work as a set. New Nodes can be added via the AddNode() methods, and new edges can be established, by passing related nodes and their weight value.

~~~~javascript
var geoGraph = new GT.Graph();
geoGraph.addNode(nyc);
geoGraph.addNode(mwk);
geoGraph.addNode(phil);

geoGraph.addEdge(mwk, phil, 400),
geoGraph.addEdge(phil, nyc, 200),
geoGraph.addEdge(nyc, mwk, 500);
~~~~

Given an initial node can be traversed via bfs(breadthFirstSearch) depthTraverse(depthFirstSearch) and dijkstra(shortestPath)

~~~~javascript
geoGraph.depthTravers(nyc);
geoGraph.bfs(phil);
geoGraph.dijkstra(mwk);
~~~~
